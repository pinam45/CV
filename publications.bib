	abstract = {Making use of the `Veldkamp blow-up' recipe, introduced by Saniga et al. (Ann Inst H Poincar{\'e} D 2:309--333, 2015) for binary Segre varieties, we study geometric hyperplanes and Veldkamp lines of Segre varieties {\$}{\$}S{\_}k(3){\$}{\$}Sk(3), where {\$}{\$}S{\_}k(3){\$}{\$}Sk(3)stands for the k-fold direct product of projective lines of size four and k runs from 2 to 4. Unlike the binary case, the Veldkamp spaces here feature also non-projective elements. Although for {\$}{\$}k=2{\$}{\$}k=2such elements are found only among Veldkamp lines, for {\$}{\$}k {\backslash}ge 3{\$}{\$}k≥3they are also present among Veldkamp points of the associated Segre variety. Even if we consider only projective geometric hyperplanes, we find four different types of non-projective Veldkamp lines of {\$}{\$}S{\_}3(3){\$}{\$}S3(3), having 2268 members in total, and five more types if non-projective ovoids are also taken into account. Sole geometric and combinatorial arguments lead to as many as 62 types of projective Veldkamp lines of {\$}{\$}S{\_}3(3){\$}{\$}S3(3), whose blowing-ups yield 43 distinct types of projective geometric hyperplanes of {\$}{\$}S{\_}4(3){\$}{\$}S4(3). As the latter number falls short of 48, the number of different large orbits of {\$}{\$}2 {\backslash}times 2 {\backslash}times 2 {\backslash}times 2{\$}{\$}2{\texttimes}2{\texttimes}2{\texttimes}2arrays over the three-element field found by Bremner and Stavrou (Lin Multilin Algebra 61:986--997, 2013), there are five (explicitly indicated) hyperplane types such that each is the fusion of two different large orbits. Furthermore, we single out those 22 types of geometric hyperplanes of {\$}{\$}S{\_}4(3){\$}{\$}S4(3), featuring 7,176,640 members in total, that are in a one-to-one correspondence with the points lying on the unique hyperbolic quadric {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}Q{\}}{\_}0^{\{}+{\}}(15,3) {\backslash}subset {\backslash}mathrm{\{}PG{\}}(15,3) {\backslash}subset {\backslash}mathcal {\{}V{\}}(S{\_}4(3)){\$}{\$}Q0+(15,3)⊂PG(15,3)⊂V(S4(3)); and, out of them, seven types that correspond bijectively to the set of 91,840 generators of the symplectic polar space {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}W{\}}(7,3) {\backslash}subset {\backslash}mathcal {\{}V{\}}(S{\_}3(3)){\$}{\$}W(7,3)⊂V(S3(3)). For {\$}{\$}k=3{\$}{\$}k=3we also briefly discuss embedding of the binary Veldkamp space into the ternary one. Interestingly, only 15 (out of 41) types of lines of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}V{\}}(S{\_}3(2)){\$}{\$}V(S3(2))are embeddable and one of them, surprisingly, into a non-projective line of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}V{\}}(S{\_}3(3)){\$}{\$}V(S3(3))only.},
